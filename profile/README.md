## Our story

Our story is similar to most other Premium WordPress Plugin agencies out there. 

We started as a small 3-man team about five years ago when we acquired our first premium WordPress plugin – [Modula](https://wordpress.org/plugins/modula-best-grid-gallery/). 

We’ve been working with WordPress for the past five years, and we are committed to delivering solutions that people love to use.

What makes us unique, though, and I know almost everyone else claims this as well – but check out our public-facing reviews, and you’ll see for yourselves – is our dedication to delivering user-pleasing solutions in a way that helps our people save time and money or effort. 

What started as an experiment in which we wanted to move away from building custom themes for clients has become our most successful venture. 
We’ve got several never seen the light of day products behind us (failures), and we fail almost every day – but we pick ourselves up and figure out a way to improve our processes, deliverables, and products. 

Through this series of iterations, we’ve learned – a LOT. We’ve packed all of these learnings into a core suite of products, for which we stand proud today and promote under the WPChill brand.
When you become a paying user for any of our products, you don’t just buy a product; you get a partner you can rely on.

This is just the beginning of our story – stay tuned for more. Oh, and you should check out our blog.
